c4 - C in four functions
========================

An exercise in minimalism.

Try the following:

    gcc -o c4 c4.c
    ./c4 hello.c
    ./c4 -s hello.c

    ./c4 c4.c hello.c
    ./c4 c4.c c4.c hello.c

Modifications
=============

This is a fork of [rswier/c4](https://github.com/rswier/c4/tree/master) with the
following modifications:

1. Added an option `-b` to dump the bytecode in a textual format.
2. Made the bytecode format relocatable so that it can be loaded at any address.

The `c4.sh` script can be used to run the generated bytecode.

Try the following:

    ./c4 -b fib.c > fib.op
    cat fib.op | ./c4.sh

You'll notice that it's not very fast!
